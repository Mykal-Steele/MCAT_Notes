# Unit 1 Amino acids and proteins

## The structure and function of globular proteins
**Structure and Function of Proteins**

- Globular proteins depend on precise three-dimensional structures for proper function.
- Proteins are composed of amino acids linked in chains by peptide bonds.
- The order of amino acids is determined by genes.

**Levels of Protein Structure**

- Primary structure: Amino acid sequence and peptide bonds.
- Secondary structure: 3D organization of main chain atoms; includes alpha helices and beta sheets.
- Tertiary structure: 3D organization of all atoms, including side chains (Primary and secondary structures connected/crumpled together + water).
- Quaternary structure: 3D organization of multi-subunit proteins (Multiple tertiary structures connected together).
  
**Formation of Protein Structures**

- Structures form due to attractive and repulsive forces between amino acids and their environment, creating **native conformations**.

## Why do native conformations happen?
- Because of **Entropy**: Proper folding maximizes the freedom of movement for surrounding water molecules, with hydrophobic residues on the outside and hydrophilic residues on the inside, resulting in less disruption of the water molecules' hydrogen bonding network.

  
**Diseases from Protein Structure Errors**

- Structural errors can lead to diseases like sickle cell anemia and fatal familial sleeping sickness.
  - Sickle cell anemia - genetic mutation that alters the shape of the hemoglobin(transfer oxygen) molecules
- Occasionally, structural changes can enhance protein function, e.g., Eero MÃ¤ntyranta's enhanced EPO receptors.

**Gene Therapy**

- Aims to correct errors in protein structure by fixing genetic instructions.
- Techniques like CRISPR-cas9 can edit DNA but may have unintended consequences.
- Ongoing research is addressing these challenges to safely apply gene therapy.
