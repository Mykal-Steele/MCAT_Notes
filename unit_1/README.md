# Unit 1: Amino Acids and Proteins

## Introduction to Proteins

### Structure and Function of Globular Proteins

- Globular proteins depend on precise three-dimensional structures for proper function.
- Proteins are composed of amino acids linked in chains by peptide bonds.
- The order of amino acids is determined by genes.

### Levels of Protein Structure

- **Primary Structure**: Amino acid sequence and peptide bonds.
- **Secondary Structure**: 3D organization of main chain atoms; includes alpha helices and beta sheets.
- **Tertiary Structure**: 3D organization of all atoms, including side chains (Primary and secondary structures connected/crumpled together + water).
- **Quaternary Structure**: 3D organization of multi-subunit proteins (Multiple tertiary structures connected together).

### Formation of Protein Structures

- Structures form due to attractive and repulsive forces between amino acids and their environment, creating **native conformations**.

#### Why do Native Conformations Happen?

- Because of **Entropy**: Proper folding maximizes the freedom of movement for surrounding water molecules, with hydrophobic residues on the outside and hydrophilic residues on the inside, resulting in less disruption of the water molecules' hydrogen bonding network.

### Diseases from Protein Structure Errors

- Structural errors can lead to diseases like sickle cell anemia and fatal familial sleeping sickness.
  - Sickle cell anemia: Genetic mutation that alters the shape of hemoglobin molecules affecting oxygen transport.
- Occasionally, structural changes can enhance protein function, e.g., Eero MÃ¤ntyranta's enhanced EPO receptors (EPO is a hormone that increases red blood cell counts, enhancing oxygen transport during exercise).

### Gene Therapy

- Aims to correct errors in protein structure by fixing genetic instructions.
- Techniques like CRISPR-cas9 can edit DNA but may have unintended consequences.
- Ongoing research is addressing these challenges to safely apply gene therapy.

## Amino Acid Structure and Function

### Introduction

Amino acids are fundamental building blocks of proteins, essential for various biological processes.

### Hemoglobin Example

- **Function**: Found in red blood cells, hemoglobin transports oxygen throughout the body.
- **Analogy**: Hemoglobin functions like a vehicle transporting oxygen molecules to tissues.

### Amino Acid Structure

- **Basic Structure**: Amino acids consist of an amino group, carboxylic acid group, and a unique side chain (R group).
- **Chiral Carbon**: The alpha carbon in amino acids is a chiral carbon with four unique groups, except for glycine.
- **L and D Configurations**: L-amino acids are predominant in human biology due to their specific configurations.

### Fischer Projections

- **Visual Representation**: Fischer projections depict the arrangement of groups around a chiral carbon, distinguishing between L and D configurations.
- **Enantiomers**: L and D configurations are mirror images that are not superimposable.

### Importance of Amino Acids

- **Protein Synthesis**: Amino acids link together via peptide bonds to form proteins.
- **Structural Variability**: Twenty different amino acids contribute to diverse protein structures and functions.
