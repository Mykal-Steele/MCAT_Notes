# Unit 1: Amino Acids and Proteins

## Introduction to Proteins 


### Structure and Function of Globular Proteins

- Globular proteins depend on precise three-dimensional structures for proper function.
- Proteins are composed of amino acids linked in chains by peptide bonds.
- The order of amino acids is determined by genes.

### Levels of Protein Structure

- **Primary Structure**: Amino acid sequence and peptide bonds.
- **Secondary Structure**: 3D organization of main chain atoms; including alpha helices and beta sheets.
- **Tertiary Structure**: 3D organization of all atoms, including side chains (Primary and secondary structures connected/crumpled together + water).
- **Quaternary Structure**: 3D organization of multi-subunit proteins (Multiple tertiary structures connected together).

### Formation of Protein Structures

- Structures form due to attractive and repulsive forces between amino acids and their environment, creating **native conformations**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Native Conformations**: Proper folding maximizes the freedom of movement for surrounding water molecules, with hydrophobic residues on the inside and hydrophilic residues on the outside, resulting in less disruption of the water molecules' hydrogen bonding network (promoting entropy).


### Diseases from Protein Structure Errors

- Structural errors can lead to diseases like sickle cell anemia and fatal familial sleeping sickness.
  - Sickle cell anemia: Genetic mutation that alters the shape of hemoglobin molecules affecting oxygen transport.
- Occasionally, structural changes can enhance protein function, e.g., Eero Mäntyranta's enhanced EPO receptors (EPO is a hormone that increases red blood cell counts, enhancing oxygen transport during exercise).

### Gene Therapy

- Aims to correct errors in protein structure by fixing genetic instructions.
- Techniques like CRISPR-cas9 can edit DNA but may have unintended consequences.
- Ongoing research is addressing these challenges to safely apply gene therapy.

## Amino Acid Structure and Function

### Introduction

Amino acids are fundamental building blocks of proteins, essential for various biological processes.

### Hemoglobin Example

- **Function**: Found in red blood cells, hemoglobin transports oxygen throughout the body.
- **Analogy**: Hemoglobin functions like a vehicle transporting oxygen molecules to tissues.

### Amino Acid Structure

- **Basic Structure**: Amino acids consist of an amino group, carboxylic acid group, and a unique side-chain (R group).
- **Chiral Carbon**: The alpha carbon in amino acids is a chiral carbon with four unique groups, except for glycine.
- **L and D Configurations**: L-amino acids are predominant in human biology due to their specific configurations.

### Fischer Projections

- **Visual Representation**: Fischer projections depict the arrangement of groups around a chiral carbon, distinguishing between L and D configurations.
- **Enantiomers**: L and D configurations are mirror images that are not superimposable.

### Importance of Amino Acids

- **Protein Synthesis**: Amino acids link together via peptide bonds to form proteins.
- **Structural Variability**: Twenty different amino acids contribute to diverse protein structures and functions.

# Unit 2: Peptide Bonds and Polypeptides: Formation and Cleavage

## Peptide Bond Formation

### Basics of Peptide Bonds
- **Proteins** are formed from the folding of **polypeptide chains**.
- **Polypeptide chains** are formed by linking amino acids together through **peptide bonds**.

### Structure of an Amino Acid
- **Backbone**: Consists of an amino group (NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (COOH), an alpha carbon (Cα), and a variable side chain (R group).

### Formation of Peptide Bonds
- **Peptide bonds** are a type of **amide bond**.
- They are formed through a **condensation reaction** (a type of nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction).
- **Participants in the reaction**:
  - **Nucleophile**: The amino group (NH₂) of one amino acid.
  - **Electrophile**: The carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the carboxyl group (COOH) of another amino acid.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Reaction Steps**:
> 1. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the amino group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxyl group.
> 2. This forms a tetrahedral intermediate.
> 3. The intermediate collapses, releasing a molecule of water (H₂O).
> 4. A covalent bond (peptide bond) is formed between the carbon of the carboxyl group and the nitrogen of the amino group.
> - The resulting structure is called a **dipeptide**, consisting of two amino acids linked by a peptide bond.

### Characteristics of Peptide Bonds
- **Planarity**: Peptide bonds are planar due to resonance, leading to restricted rotation around the bond.
- **Double Bond Character**: The partial double bond character from resonance makes the bond rigid and less flexible.
- **Stabilization**: Resonance delocalization of electrons from the nitrogen to the carbonyl oxygen stabilizes the peptide bond.

## Polypeptide Chains

### Structure of Polypeptide Chains
- Polypeptides have a repeating pattern: nitrogen atom, alpha carbon, and carbonyl carbon.
- The chain starts with an **amino (N) terminal** and ends with a **carboxyl (C) terminal**.
- Each amino acid within a polypeptide chain is called a **residue**.

### Flexibility of Polypeptide Chains
- While peptide bonds are rigid, free rotation is possible around the alpha carbon atoms.

## Cleavage of Peptide Bonds

### Hydrolysis of Peptide Bonds
- **Hydrolysis** breaks peptide bonds to form free amino acids.
- Two common methods:
  - **Acid hydrolysis**: Uses strong acids and heat, a nonspecific method.
  - **Proteolysis**: Uses proteolytic enzymes (proteases), a specific method.

### Acid Hydrolysis
- Nonspecific cleavage with strong acids and heat, resulting in a mix of amino acids.

### Proteolytic Cleavage
- Specific cleavage by proteases.
- Example: **Trypsin** cleaves on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids (arginine and lysine).

### Examples of Proteolytic Cleavage
- **Trypsin** cleaves specifically after arginine and lysine residues.
- Cleavage results in distinct polypeptide fragments.

## Summary

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Points**:
> - Peptide bonds link amino acids to form polypeptide chains.
> - Polypeptides have repeating nitrogen-alpha carbon-carbonyl patterns.
> - Peptide bonds are rigid and planar due to resonance.
> - Peptide bonds can be broken by acid hydrolysis or proteolysis.
> - Proteolytic enzymes offer specific cleavage, while acid hydrolysis is nonspecific.

# Unit 3: Classification and Properties of Amino Acids

## Classification of Amino Acids

### Introduction

Amino acids exhibit diverse properties based on their side chains, leading to classification into distinct groups.

### Nonpolar Hydrophobic Amino Acids

Nonpolar amino acids are characterized by hydrophobic side chains, avoiding interaction with water.

### Alkyl Side Chains

- **Glycine (Gly)**: The simplest amino acid with a hydrogen atom as its side chain.
- **Alanine (Ala)**: Contains a methyl group.
- **Valine (Val)**: Branched chain with a methyl group.
- **Methionine (Met)**: Contains a sulfur atom in its side chain.
- **Leucine (Leu)**: Branched alkyl group.
- **Isoleucine (Ile)**: Another branched alkyl group.
- **Proline (Pro)**: Forms a unique ring structure affecting peptide chain flexibility. Originates from glutamic acid, with the carboxyl reduced to an aldehyde, followed by the amino group attacking to form a Schiff base and further reduction.
  - **Properties**: Proline introduces kinks in polypeptides and is often found at the beginning of alpha helices. It is nonpolar and cyclic.

> [!NOTE]
> **Schiff base**: A compound containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond derived from the condensation of an amine with an aldehyde or ketone.

> [!NOTE]
> **Aldehyde**: An organic compound containing a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to a hydrogen atom and a carbon group.

> [!NOTE]
> **Condensation reaction**: A chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form a larger molecule, typically with the loss of a small molecule such as water.

  

### Aromatic Side Chains

- **Phenylalanine (Phe)**: Aromatic ring structure.
- **Tryptophan (Trp)**: Largest amino acid with an indole ring.
  - **Properties**: Tryptophan has an indole substituent on the beta-carbon. The nitrogen in the indole group does not have a free lone pair to act as a base due to resonance. It is nonpolar and aromatic.

> [!NOTE]
> **Indole ring**: A bicyclic compound containing a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring.
